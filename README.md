## Warning
This skill will not install if there isnt enough free diskspace. This is mainly because the skill needs Gb swapfile to compile and run.

Be aware that mark_1 came with only  a 4 GB ssd card. So if you hassnt changed that, the skill will not install or run.

## How to install
First encrease swapfile size. SSH to your device edit /etc/dphys-swapfile. you can do that by running the following command.

```
sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
```
change CONF_SWAPSIZE=100 to CONF_SWAPSIZE=2014
Press Ctrl+X and save the file
Restart dphys-swapfile by running following commands
```
sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile stop
sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile start
```
Be aware this can take some time, and will slow down your device when the new swapfile is beeing made.

On mark_1 the firewall needs to be opend on port 3000. This is done by running the command
```
sudo ufw allow from any to any port 3000 proto tcp
```

Install the skill by running this command
```
mycroft-msm install https://github.com/andlo/theia-ide-skill.git
```
Skill will then install THEIA IDE. This takes more than 15 minutes, and will slow your Mycroft device during install and when compiling node-modules.

When done, there should be a log info saying "Starting THEIA IDE" and Mycrot should tell you by voice that he has installed the skill.
You can then open a web-browser and g√• to http://picroft:3000 if your Mycroft device is picroft. If on a Mark One go to http://mark_1:3000
You then get access to the THEIA IDE in a workplace located /opt/mycroft/skills.
